<p class="title">Option 1: Data Flow Diagramming

5/5 - (3 votes)

DFDs are process diagrams that emphasize the data consumed, produced, and stored by processes under discussion. Complex processes are decomposed into their constituent elements to reveal the most elemental sub-processes and their use of data atoms. In a 2- to 3-page paper, describe process decomposition and flow balancing so that non-technical participating stakeholders can understand the notation of the DFD and the requirements specification value it contains. Your goal is to ensure that your stakeholders can help you validate your DFD.

Include a title page and reference page.
